# STEM-EdTools

A comprehensive collection of open-source educational tools for teaching and learning various STEM concepts, with a focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Overview

STEM-EdTools is a repository containing multiple educational applications designed to make complex STEM concepts accessible through interactive visualizations and hands-on learning experiences. Each tool is self-contained with its own documentation and can be used independently.

## Available Tools

### ðŸ¤– [Reinforcement Learning Education Tool (RLEd)](reinforcement-learning/README.md)

An interactive GUI application for learning reinforcement learning concepts through visualization and real-time training analysis.

**Key Features:**
- 10+ RL algorithms (Q-Learning, DQN, REINFORCE, etc.)
- 4 environments (CartPole, MountainCar, Acrobot, GridWorld)
- Real-time training visualization
- Interactive Q-table exploration
- Policy animation and comparison tools

**Perfect for:** Students learning RL, educators teaching AI concepts, researchers exploring algorithm performance

### ðŸ“Š [Sampling Biases Learning Tool](sampling-biases/README.md)

An interactive application that teaches about sampling biases and data representativeness in machine learning using the MNIST dataset.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive class selection for digit datasets
- Dynamic dataset size control
- Real-time neural network training
- Performance analysis with per-class accuracy
- Educational experiments demonstrating various types of sampling bias
- Bias type identification and explanation

**Perfect for:** Machine learning beginners, data science students, understanding bias in data collection and preparation
